You are a professional web developer and designer tasked with creating a futuristic website for **Precilayer**, a next-generation Indian manufacturing company. The goal is to make manufacturing look "cool" and aspirational, while communicating trust, innovation, and global competitiveness.  

### Brand & Vision
- Precilayer aims to position India as a global leader in precision manufacturing and engineering.  
- Vision: "Serve the best of Indian manufacturing by challenging the status quo and positioning India as a hardware leader globally."  
- Mission: "Redefine Indian manufacturing by uniting precision machining and additive technologies to deliver world-class components that drive innovation in aerospace, healthcare, mobility, and automation."  

### Core Messages
1. Manufacturing products in India at global quality is now possible, accessible, and affordable.  
2. The future of manufacturing is **custom batch production** — high variety, low to mid-volume — and Precilayer is ready to enable that.  

### Target Users
- Founders, sourcing/purchase engineers, and design engineers.  
- They must leave with the impression that Precilayer reduces nonproductive time, lowers costs, and improves product quality.  

### Desired Website Attributes
The site should feel:  
- Futuristic, Cutting Edge, Modern, Powerful, Accessible, Smart, Creative, Stable, and Trustworthy.  
- Inspired by SpaceX, Protolabs, and Path Robotics.  

### Design Guidelines
- Sleek, modern design with futuristic typography and high-contrast visuals (black/white + accent neon/tech colors).  
- Hero section with strong tagline: **“Redefining Indian Manufacturing for the Future.”**  
- Sections:  
  1. **Why** – Changing the perception of Indian manufacturing.  
  2. **How** – Blending additive + subtractive manufacturing.  
  3. **What** – High quality, lowest cost, fastest turnaround.  
  4. **Industries Served** – Aerospace, Drones, Robotics & Automation, Healthcare, Climate Tech, Energy, Satellite & Space, Advanced Air Mobility, Medical Devices, Electric Ground Mobility, Oil & Gas.
