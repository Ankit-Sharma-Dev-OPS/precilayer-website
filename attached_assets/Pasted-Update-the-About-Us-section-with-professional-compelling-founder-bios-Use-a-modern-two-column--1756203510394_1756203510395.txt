**Design Notes:**  
- Use two equal-width columns (Roshan left, Priyesh right).  
- Add placeholder images above each bio with futuristic hover effects.  
- Ensure bios are styled with balanced line length (not too wide).  
- Keep typography modern and professional — bold names, clear hierarchy.
