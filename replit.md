# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The application follows a modern React-based single-page application (SPA) architecture with component-based design patterns. The frontend uses functional components with React hooks for state management and lifecycle operations. Animation and interactivity are handled through Framer Motion for smooth, performant animations. The routing system is implemented using Wouter for client-side navigation.

## Component Structure
The UI is built with a comprehensive design system using shadcn/ui components, providing consistent styling and behavior across the application. Components are organized into logical sections (hero, navigation, features, contact, etc.) with reusable UI primitives. The styling approach leverages Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with custom CSS variables for theming and futuristic design elements.

## Build System
The project uses Vite as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds. TypeScript is used throughout for type safety and better developer experience. The build process includes separate client and server compilation, with the client assets being served statically in production.

## Development Environment
The application is configured for both development and production environments with hot module replacement (HMR) support in development. Custom Vite plugins are integrated for Replit-specific features and error handling.
